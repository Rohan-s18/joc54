## CSDS 391: Programming Assignment 2

This zip contains the source code for Programming assignment 2 for CSDS 391. This will help you navigate you through all of the python modules that I created for this project.  

**NOTE:** I used plotly as an external library to plot my results, so you might need to install that depending on your environment, it came pre-installed with my conda environment.  

Here is a list of all of the source code for each question:-  
    **1) Exercise 1: Clustering**  
        - EX_1_ab.py: This module contains the N-Dimensional KMeans code used for parts a and b.    
        - EX_1_cd.py: This module contains the 2-D KMeans code and plotting functions for parts c and d.  
    **2) Exercise 2: Linear Decision Boundaries**   
        - EX_2.py: This contains the source code required for all of the parts of Exercise 2 (Linear Decision Boundaries).    
    **3) Exercise 3: Neural Networks**    
        - EX_3_ab.py: This module contains the source code for calculating and plotting the mean-squared error. Note I calculated Total Squared error in the function and then convert it into Mean Squared error.   
        - EX_3_e.py: This module contains the source code for part e (Summed Gradient).  
    **4) Exercise 4: Learning a decision boundary through optimization**  
        - EX_4.py: This module contains the code for Gradient Descent (Exercise 4).     
    **5) Exercise 5: Extra Credit**  
        - MLP_Scikit.py: This module contains the code for a multi layer neural network using Sci-kit learn.   
        - NFL_Analysis.py: This module contains the real-life example for Extra Credit.  

This folder also contains the following files:  
    - NFL_Analysis.csv: This csv file contains the data that I used for my non-trivial extra credit example.  
    - irisdata.csv: THis CSV file contains the iris dataset.
