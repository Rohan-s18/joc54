# Single Layer Neural Network for Classification
## Author: Rohan Singh
This directory contains the source code for a single-layer non-linear neural network for classification. The code in this directory is a good stepping sotne to understand how to implement neural networks. In this example I have used a 2-parameter dataset form the fischer iris dataset.  

## Background
The non-linearity in this neural network is described by a logistic function (sigmoid function). We will classify the different species of iris using logistic regression with optimized parameters using gradient descent.
