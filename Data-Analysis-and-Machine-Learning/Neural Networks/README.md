# Neural Networks
## Author: Rohan Singh
This directory contains source code for different types of Neural Networks. This includes, single-layered networks, multi-layered networks, as well as networks with different non-linearities (Sigmoid, Tanh etc.).  
**All of these modules are made from scratch (No Scikit/Keras used)**

## Contents
This directory contains the following Neural Network implementaions:  
    - **Single-Layer Network for classification:** This directory contains the source code for a single-layered neural network used for classification using 2 paramters. This is a good starting point for learning how neural networks are implemented, since there isn't a lot of advanced stuff involved.
